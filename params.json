In common designs such as the horizontal sundial, the sun casts a \r\nshadow from its style onto a surface marked with lines indicating the hours of the day. The\r\nstyle is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, often a thin rod or a sharp, straight edge. As\r\nthe sun moves across the sky, the shadow-edge aligns with different hour-lines. All sundials \r\nmust be aligned with their styles parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation to tell the \r\ncorrect time throughout the year. The style's angle from the horizontal will thus equal the \r\nsundial's geographical latitude. It is common for inexpensive mass-produced decorative sundials \r\nto have incorrect hour angles, which cannot be adjusted to tell correct time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n======\r\n\r\nGuiQuan \"guiquanz\" Zhang (张桂权) <guiqzhang@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright and License\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThis Software is licensed under the BSD license.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 by GuiQuan \"guiquanz\" Zhang (张桂权) <guiqzhang@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and\r\nits documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby\r\ngranted, provided that the above copyright notice appear in all\r\ncopies and that both the copyright notice and this permission\r\nnotice and warranty disclaimer appear in supporting\r\ndocumentation, and that the name of Lucent Technologies or any of\r\nits entities not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining\r\nto distribution of the software without specific, written prior\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nLUCENT TECHNOLOGIES DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS\r\nSOFTWARE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\r\nFITNESS.
