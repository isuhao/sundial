What is Sundial?
================

A [sundial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial) is a device that tells the time of day by 
the position of the Sun. In common designs such as the horizontal sundial, the sun casts a 
shadow from its style onto a surface marked with lines indicating the hours of the day. The
style is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, often a thin rod or a sharp, straight edge. As
the sun moves across the sky, the shadow-edge aligns with different hour-lines. All sundials 
must be aligned with their styles parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation to tell the 
correct time throughout the year. The style's angle from the horizontal will thus equal the 
sundial's geographical latitude. It is common for inexpensive mass-produced decorative sundials 
to have incorrect hour angles, which cannot be adjusted to tell correct time.
